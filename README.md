I am a faculty member and this site is used as a storage 
location for my online educational resources.

All applets are created using the excellent projects I 
have found: JSXGraph, ThreeJS and MathBox. I apologize
if I don't credit you enough in my code, these are all
in the early creation stages and I do plan on adding
additional credits as I grow my library.

Here's to hoping some other math instructor may find these
and if you don't find my applets useful, maybe you can
modify them to your own liking or use them as examples
on how to create your own.

If you do have suggestions on how to improve my applets,
please feel free to let me know!
